# Java Practice Repository ☕🚀

Welcome to my Java Practice Repository!

Every file in this project represents **one more step forward** on my journey to mastering Java. Whether it's a simple `HelloWorld.java` or a mini banking application, each program is a hands-on experience that helps me understand core concepts and build confidence in coding.

## 📚 What's Inside

- ✅ Basic syntax and structure  
- 📥 Getting input from users  
- 🔢 Variables, data types, and operators  
- 🔁 Loops and conditionals  
- 🧮 Math and logic practice  
- 📄 Working with files (coming soon)  
- 🧪 Small projects like a banking app, calculator, etc.

## 🎯 My Goal

To go from Java beginner to building real-world, efficient Java applications. This repo helps me stay organized, track progress, and keep learning consistently.

## 📌 Notes

- Each `.java` file is self-contained and commented where needed.
- Practice files are named clearly based on the lesson or concept.
- Some files include example input/output in the comments.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java installed (`java -version` to check).
2. Navigate to the folder in terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
